# Readme

- This repo is for my journey towards mastering the systematic use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API for GeoSpatial data projects.
 
- I find this to be a really useful way to work and I hope to make it into a training course eventually.
 
- My education included a lot of maths and physics, but I work with ecologists.  It's an interesting mix.  The general philosophy here is to find ways I can merge reproducable science with advanced computational methods. 

- Currently trying to figure out a clean and easy way to deal with the setup on Linux and Windows.
