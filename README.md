# Readme

- This repo is for my journey towards mastering the systematic use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API for GeoSpatial data projects.   I hope to make it into a training course eventually.
 
- I find the Conda-Jupyter combination really useful for initial data exploration & process development, even if I might drop it in later stages of a project.
 
- The general theme here is to make myself useful to science subject specialists, by enabling advanced computational, sensing & measurement methods.
  
- A bit more specifically, I'm looking for systematic ways to make statistical spatial models from the large volumes of probabilistic data that these new sensing & remote sensing methods create in problems like wildlife and ecosystem monitoring.

- Currently still just trying to figure out a clean and easy way to deal with the setup for the QGIS-Conda-Jupyter combination on Linux and Windows, that's sufficiently IDE agnostic.
