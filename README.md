# Readme

- This repo is for my journey towards mastering the use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API.
 
- This is a non-trivial thing.  The Conda QGIS distribution is only a subest of all the avaliable processes.  For the full potential of QGIS, the Python environment will need access to the Plugins location and use the plugins without dependancy conflict.

- The main prize here is to be able to have the reproducibility and convenience of Conda for data & ML projects + The Geospatial awesomeness of QGIS, plus the logical workflow, and presentability of a Jupyter notebooks.

- It also means that the end result is only a step or two away from being packagable as a custom QGIS application, or a QGIS plugin, which would be a great fit for the people I work with.
 
- The general theme here is to make myself useful to science subject specialists in a variety of fields, by enabling advanced computational, sensing & measurement methods.
