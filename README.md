# Readme

- This repo is for my journey towards mastering the use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API.  I think this would be a great fit for the kind of work I do.
 
- This is a non-trivial thing, QGIS in Windows has it's own Python Interpreter, whilst in Linux it works with the system base interpreter.  In either case the Conda environment will need access to the QGIS Plugins location and work without conflict to harness all the potential of QGIS.

- The main prize here is to be able to have the reproducibility and convenience of Conda for data & ML projects + The Geospatial awesomeness of QGIS, plus the logical workflow, and presentability of a Jupyter notebooks.

- It also means that the end result is only a step or two away from being packagable as a custom QGIS application, or a QGIS plugin, which would be a great fit for the people I work with.
 
- The general theme here is to make myself useful to science subject specialists in a variety of fields, by enabling advanced computational, sensing & measurement methods.
  
- A bit more specifically, I'm looking for systematic ways to make statistical spatial models from the large volumes of probabilistic data that these new remote sensing & AI methods create in problems like wildlife and ecosystem monitoring.
