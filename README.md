This repo is for my journey towards mastering the systematic use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API for GeoSpatial data projects. 

 Currently trying to figure out a clean and reproducible way to deal with the setup on Linux and Windows.

I find this to be a really useful way to work and I hope to make it into a training course eventually.
