# Readme

- This repo is for my journey towards mastering the use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API.
 
- This is a non-trivial thing.  My solution is a little hacky, and I am aware that [Quantstack](https://quantstack.net/) may be working on what I imagine will be something much more elegent.

-  I'm mostly interested in the application of the idea rather than fighting with my computer.  Applying a standardised process to a variety of interesting contexts, maybe producing a training course or some other instructions for my colleagues & others with interests in biodiversity & earth sciences.

- The main prize here is to be able to have the efficiency, reproducibility and convenience of Conda for data & ML projects + The Geospatial awesomeness of QGIS, plus the logical workflow, and presentability of a Jupyter notebooks.

- It also means that the end result is only a step or two away from being packagable as a custom QGIS application, or a QGIS plugin, which would be a great fit for the people I work with, or the notebook its self can be the final document, or it can be hosted and interactive on the Web.

- I'm mostly working on-site with the New Zealand [Department of Conservation](https://www.doc.govt.nz/) terestrial biodiversity group, but would love to hear from institutions with similar goals and use cases.
