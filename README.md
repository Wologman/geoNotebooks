# Readme

- This repo is for my journey towards mastering the use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API.
 
- This is a non-trivial thing.  The Conda QGIS distribution is only a subest of all the avaliable processes.  For the full potential of QGIS, the Python environment will need access the API from the systems QGIS installation without conflicting with the Conda environment.

- The main prize here is to be able to have the reproducibility and convenience of Conda for data & ML projects + The Geospatial awesomeness of QGIS, plus the logical workflow, and presentability of a Jupyter notebooks.

- It also means that the end result is only a step or two away from being packagable as a custom QGIS application, or a QGIS plugin, which would be a great fit for the people I work with, or the notebook its self can be the final document, or it can be hosted and interactive on the Web.  
 
- The general theme here is to create something useful to science & engineering subject specialists across a variety of meaningful fields, by developing general purpose open-source computational workflow.
