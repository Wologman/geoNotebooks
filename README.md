# Readme

- This repo is for my journey towards mastering the use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API.  I think this would be a great fit for the kind of work I do.
 
- I'd like to have the reproducibility and convenience of Conda for data & ML projects + The Geospatial awesomeness of QGIS, plus the logical workflow, and presentability of a Jupyter notebook.
 
- The general theme here is to make myself useful to science subject specialists, by enabling advanced computational, sensing & measurement methods.
  
- A bit more specifically, I'm looking for systematic ways to make statistical spatial models from the large volumes of probabilistic data that these new sensing & remote sensing methods create in problems like wildlife and ecosystem monitoring.

- This is a non-trivial thing, because essentially I'm working with two rival package managers, so lots of potential for conflict.  Also I'm using Conda packages in combination with a seperate .env file, which is a bit confusing to VSCode.
