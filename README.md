# Readme

*  This repo is for my journey towards mastering the use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API.
 
* This is a non-trivial thing.  My approach is a little hacky, and I'm aware that [Quantstack](https://quantstack.net/) may be working on a more elegent solution.

*  I'm mostly interested developing a standardised process applicable to a variety of interesting contexts.  I might try producing a training course or some other instructions for my colleagues & others with similar interests.

*  I'm mostly working on-site with the New Zealand [Department of Conservation](https://www.doc.govt.nz/) terestrial biodiversity group, but I would be interested to collaborate with others and apply this to a variety of use-cases. 

* The main prize here is to be able to have the efficiency, reproducibility and convenience of Conda for data & ML projects + the geospatial awesomeness of QGIS, plus the logical workflow, flexibility and presentability of a Jupyter notebooks.

* Notebooks are my prefered way to begin a data project, but not necessarily the final outcome.  This could be any of a number of things:
  - The notebook its self, with all the code for maximum transparency
  - The noteook with the code cells hidden, or the functions and classes moved to a `.py` script, leaving only the data story, and saved to html for easy distribution.
  - The notebook hosted interactively on a web server.
  - Just the derived outputs, like maps and plots.
  - With one more step, we can copy the functioning code into `.py` scripts, and package it with the dependencies into a QGIS plugin or a custom QGIS app.
