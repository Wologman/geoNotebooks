# Readme

- This repo is for my journey towards mastering the systematic use of Jupyter Notebooks & Conda with the PyQGIS API for GeoSpatial data projects.   I hope to make it into a training course eventually.
 
- I find the Conda-Jupyter combination really useful for initial data exploration & process development, even if I might drop it in later stages of a project.
 
- I work with ecologists, but my expertise is mostly in maths, physics & engineering.  The general theme here is to make myself useful to science subject specialists, by enabling advanced computational, sensing & measurement methods. 

- Currently still trying to figure out a clean and easy way to deal with the setup for the QGIS-Conda-Jupyter combination on Linux and Windows, that's sufficiently IDE agnostic.
