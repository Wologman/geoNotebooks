# Geospatial analysis with Jypyter Notebooks and QGIS
My goal for this project is to bring together the strengths of two  approaches to working with Geospatial data: 
- **QGIS** | An awesome open-source GIS package with a Python API
- **Jupyter Notebooks** | A great way to explore and visualise data sequentially in Python

## Introduction
Let's consider the strengths of each approach, that when brought together, create advantages one or the other misses.

### Advantages from QGIS
- Makes beautiful maps
- Brings together a bunch of open-source third-party Python tools, but with a consistent wrapper, making them easy to work with.
- Has some advanced geoprocessing tools not easily found from standard Python libraries.

### Advantages from Jupyter (with Conda)
- Reproducibility
- The entire workflow and any mathematical or logical arguments are preserved step by step.
- Statistical results can be plotted nicely with dedicated plotting libraries for later publication or presentation.
- Mathematical and logical arguments can be presented with the combined presentability of Markdown and LaTeX.
- The whole notebook can be converted to interactive `html` files, and the code can even be hidden for non-technical audiences.
- Works with any version of Python, or any third party libraries, including machine learning libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow
- Version control of those third party libraries and Python version, as well as integration with Git from your code editor.
- Multi-core CPU processing (in Linux only)
- GPU processing
- Can work directly with rasters as NumPy arrays for speed and memory efficiency
- Functions and classes written from one project be imported easily in future projects.

Since both these lists have some substantial benefits, this seems like quite a worthwhile endevour. Also, we should consider the end goals here.  What role would these notebooks fill and for who?

**For students**  
The reproducibility and logic to the workflows are such key concepts here, this is a great way to learn to work with spatial data, even if it is a little slower to begin with.

**For specialist science roles**  
For example monitoring biodiversity, erosion, land-use change etc.  This approach could make working with spatial data faster, more presentable and more repeatable. Especially for those types of projects that may get repeated a few times in similar ways. If a dataset needs updatating every year, and all the package versions are nicely locked down, the code should keep running smoothly.

**For Spatial Data Scientists & Machine Learning specialists**  
Or really for anybody who is providing that next level of Python & spatial data expertise to the subject specialists mentioned above.  This would cover data exploration, data cleaning, posssibly even feature engineering.  Also lifting the presentability of visualisation of our for our final models.

**For software engineers for spatial tools and QGIS plugin development**  
Working initially in notebooks can be a convenient way to do initial prototyping, visualise outcomes and troubleshoot our ideas as we go along.  Once that phase is over, everything can be moved into .py scripts.

## Setup

### Conda in Ubuntu

[Install miniConda as per the website](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)  

[Set the solver to Mamba as per instructions here](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community)

```Bash
conda update -n base conda
conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
conda config --set auto_activate_base False #optional but I think it's best because you never really want to use base for much.
```

### Setup a Python Environment with Conda

This is really important. It ensures we are being transparent and consitant with all our package and Python versions between projects.  A method shouldn't fall over randomly some day just because some underlying package has been updated.  

Open a terminal in the location of your environment.yaml files and run  
 `conda env create -f my_environment.yaml`
 replacing `my_environment.yaml` with what ever env yaml file you are working with.

Once it's complete, run `conda activate my_fancy_environment_name`  followed by `conda list` to check you've got all the packages you expected.

If some or all of the packages in the list aren't pinned to a particular version, you can do that at the end of your project.  Or at least before you start working on another machine.

### QGIS Setup in Ubuntu

[From here](https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html)

```bash
sudo apt install gnupg software-properties-common

sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg https://download.qgis.org/downloads/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg
```

Now we open a text editor in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/qgis.sources
```

Then in the case of Jammy Jellyfish paste the following.   For any other Linux release, check the release code first and replace the jammy. To check the release code type: `lsb_releaseÂ -cs` and replace jammy with that.

```Types: deb deb-src  
URIs: https://qgis.org/debian  
Suites: jammy  
Architectures: amd64  
Components: main  
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/qgis-archive-keyring.gpg 
``` 
If this worked there should be a new file `qgis.sources` located in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`.

- Control O to write to the permission directory
- Control X to exit the nano editor
- Then:  
`sudo apt update`  
`sudo apt install qgis qgis-plugin-grass`  

# Load environment variables from .env file

```bash
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os
import sys


load_dotenv()

# Modify sys.path based on PYTHONPATH
for path in os.environ['PYTHONPATH'].split(':'):
    if path not in sys.path:
        sys.path.append(path)

# Verify the setup
print('PYTHONPATH:', os.environ['PYTHONPATH'])
print('sys.path:', sys.path)

# Now you can import and use your libraries
try:
    import qgis
    import scipy
    import bpy
    print('Libraries imported successfully!')
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'Error importing libraries: {e}')

# Your processing code here

```
